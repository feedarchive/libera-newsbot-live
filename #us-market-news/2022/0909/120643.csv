r/stockmarket:25+,"[Valuation] Historical data shows (S&P 500 P/E) + (core inflation) = 20. Todayâ€™s math is (18.7 P/E)+(4.5 CI) = 23.2. The S&P would need to drop to 3,330 to get to 20 with current core inflation. Not predicting that will happen but not a compelling time to buy either.",https://redd.it/x9kb5f,
