r/stockmarket:25+,[Discussion] I owned $4 of MindMed (MNMD). I was charged $38 for a “reorganization fee”. I called the E-Trade customer service line and they explained companies can do this when their stock is tanking. Thankfully I begged her to cancel out the fee so E-Trade is covering the cost. Complete bullshit.,https://redd.it/w2b5nn,
