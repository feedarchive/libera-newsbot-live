r/stockmarket:25+,[Technical Analysis] Take a look at this chart of tesla since 2020 to now.... absolutely insanity... never seen such a bubble before in my opinion. Intel makes 10 fold these guys and isn't worth a fraction at what tesla is valued at 1 trillion... truly interesting times that is for sure lol,https://redd.it/qfngrp,
