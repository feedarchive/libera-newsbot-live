r/stockmarket:25+,"[Help Needed] How does my portfolio look? I’ve had this portfolio for about 2 weeks and I started with 7,500 and now im nearly at 8,000. I’m 18 years old and I’ve been investing for about 7 months total but I was using Robinhood before I switched to TDAmeritrade. Any feedback or advice would be appreciated!",https://redd.it/pdnb07,
